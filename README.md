# Technoir Theme

Based on [SynthWave '84 Min Darker Theme](https://github.com/FernaandoJr/synthwave-remix-min-darker) and [SynthWave '84](https://github.com/robb0wen/synthwave-vscode)

With syntax highlighting inspired by [Neon Syntax for Atom Editor](https://github.com/anomaly256/neon-syntax) which itself is based on [Farzher Neon Sublime Text 2/3 theme](https://github.com/farzher/Sublime-Text-Themes)


## To enable Glowing/Neon Syntax
If you are a Windows user, you may need to run VS Code with administrator privileges. For Linux and Mac users, Code must not be installed in a read-only location and you must have write permissions.

To activate the glow, Set your active colour theme to Technoir, open your command palette with `Ctrl + Shift + P` or `Shift + âŒ˜ + P` and choose "__Enable Neon Syntax__". It will prompt you to restart, and when you do the lights should be on.

## Use with a background
We recommend using this theme with a nice background with an extension like Katsute.code-background. Background in preview image included in img folder.
